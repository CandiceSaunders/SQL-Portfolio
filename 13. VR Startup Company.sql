    About the Dataset:
    The VR Startup Company dataset is a database that contains two tables 
    (and their columns):
    employees: employee_id, first_name, last_name, location, position, 
               personality, and current_project
    projects: project_id, project_name, start_date, end_date
    
    Project Description:
    Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc. is the latest startup on the VR scene.

    eeding to be delivered. Your main responsibility is to analyze our current talent pool to 
    ensure each project can be completed efficiently and effectively. (Each project needs a Project Manager,
